        <h2>Therapies that can help with Autism :</h2>
        A number of therapies can help people with autism improve their abilities and reduce their symptoms.<br>
        Starting therapy early during preschool or before improves the chances for your child’s success<br><br>
        <b>Play Therapy:</b><br>
        Many children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), playing is the way they express themselves their toys and their actions may become their words.<br> 
        Play can help children with ASD learn and connect with other people, both children and adults, in a way they understand.
        Play therapy can improve their social and emotional skills, help them think in different ways, add to their language or
        communication skills, and expand the ways they play with toys and relate to other people.<br>
        <b>Occupational Therapy:</b><br>
         Occupational  therapy helps with activities of daily living and the use of everyday objects,
        like learning to button a shirt or hold a fork the right way.<br> But it can involve anything related to school,
         work, or play. <br>The focus depends on the child’s needs and goals.</b>
